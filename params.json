{"name":"mysql-unit","tagline":"Testing framework for stored routines in MySQL","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\n**`mysql-unit`** is a framework for testing stored code in MySQL. It will allow you to create & run tests for your code in automatic mode, using simple API. Testing for stored code is important right as it is for regular application code - because stored code also contains logic. If your intention is to write stable and secure stored code - then automated testing for it is mandatory. And that is the purpose of this project.\r\n\r\n# Supported features\r\n\r\nCurrently, **`mysql-unit`** is available only for _MySQL 5.6_ and above. There are many implemented features, most important of them are:\r\n\r\n* Testing for stored functions.\r\n* Testing for stored procedures.\r\n* Wide count of DDL checks\r\n* Dynamic expressions evaluating\r\n* SQL exceptions expectations handling\r\n* Extended test failure trace\r\n\r\nThis is a brief features overview, but, however, you can find description for any specific feature in the corresponding documentation page.\r\n\r\n# Credits & License\r\n\r\nThis software is published under GPLv2 (GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE).

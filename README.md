mysql-unit
==========

Testing framework for stored routines in MySQL. Both functions and procedures are supported.



**Plans**
 
- API for adding/maintaining tests. 
- Enable MySQL 5.5 support. Unfortunately, version `5.5` has some bugs with error handling, thus, it won't be possible to emulate full support.

MySQL < 5.5 is _not planned_ and _won't be supported_.
